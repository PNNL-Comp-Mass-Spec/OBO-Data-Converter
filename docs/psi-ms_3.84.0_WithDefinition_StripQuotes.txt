MS:1000782MS1	Savitzky-Golay smoothing	MS:1000782	1	Reduces intensity spikes by applying local polynomial regression (of degree k) on a distribution (of at least k+1 equally spaced points) to determine the smoothed value for each point. It tends to preserve features of the distribution such as relative maxima, minima and width, which are usually 'flattened' by other adjacent averaging techniques.
MS:1000783MS1	LOWESS smoothing	MS:1000783	1	Reduces intensity spikes by applying a modelling method known as locally weighted polynomial regression. At each point in the data set a low-degree polynomial is fit to a subset of the data, with explanatory variable values near the point whose response is being estimated. The polynomial is fit using weighted least squares, giving more weight to points near the point whose response is being estimated and less weight to points further away. The value of the regression function for the point is then obtained by evaluating the local polynomial using the explanatory variable values for that data point. The LOESS fit is complete after regression function values have been computed for each of the n data points. Many of the details of this method, such as the degree of the polynomial model and the weights, are flexible.
