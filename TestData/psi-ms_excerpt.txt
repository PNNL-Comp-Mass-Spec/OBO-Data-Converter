MS:1000097MS1	constant neutral mass loss	MS:1000097	1	OBSOLETE A spectrum formed of all product ions that have been produced with a selected m/z decrement from any precursor ions. The spectrum shown correlates to the precursor ion spectrum. See also neutral loss spectrum.	This former purgatory term was made obsolete.		
MS:1000098MS1	multiple ion monitoring	MS:1000098	1	OBSOLETE Data acquired when monitoring the ion current of a few specific m/z values. Remap to MS:1000205 -Selected Ion Monitoring.	This former purgatory term was made obsolete.		
MS:1000099MS1	multiple reaction monitoring	MS:1000099	1	OBSOLETE This term is not recommended. See Selected Reaction Monitoring.	This term was made obsolete because it was merged with selected reaction monitoring (MS:1000206).		
MS:1000100MS1	precursor ion scan	MS:1000100	1	OBSOLETE The specific scan function or process that will record a precursor ion spectrum.	This former purgatory term was made obsolete.		
MS:1000101MS1	product ion scan	MS:1000101	1	OBSOLETE The specific scan function or process that records product ion spectrum.	This former purgatory term was made obsolete.		
MS:1000102MS1	single ion monitoring	MS:1000102	1	OBSOLETE The operation of a mass spectrometer to monitor a single ion rather than scanning entire mass spectrum.	This term was made obsolete because it was replaced by single ion monitoring (MS:100205).		
MS:1000103MS1	single reaction monitoring	MS:1000103	1	OBSOLETE This term is not recommended. See Selected Reaction Monitoring.	This term was made obsolete because it was replaced by selected reaction monitoring (MS:1000206).		
MS:1000104MS1	None ??	MS:1000104	1	OBSOLETE None.	This term was made obsolete because .		
MS:1000105MS1	reflectron off	MS:1000105	1	Reflectron is off.		reflectron state	MS:1000021	mass analyzer attribute	MS:1000480
MS:1000106MS1	reflectron on	MS:1000106	1	Reflectron is on.		reflectron state	MS:1000021	mass analyzer attribute	MS:1000480
MS:1000107MS1	channeltron	MS:1000107	1	A horn-shaped (or cone-shaped) continuous dynode particle multiplier. The ion strikes the inner surface of the device and induces the production of secondary electrons that in turn impinge on the inner surfaces to produce more secondary electrons. This avalanche effect produces an increase in signal in the final measured current pulse.		detector type	MS:1000026	detector	MS:1000453
MS:1000108MS1	conversion dynode electron multiplier	MS:1000108	1	A surface that is held at high potential so that ions striking the surface produce electrons that are subsequently detected.		conversion dynode	MS:1000346
